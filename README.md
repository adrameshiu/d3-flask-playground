# D3 Playground

A place for me to experiment and learn working with D3.



## Usage

- Activate the virtual environment set up

- Run the main python script using the command ```python app.py```. This boots up the flask server.
- Open app.py to see the templates/html pages defined and try them
- To see the main d3 graph, open the link  http://localhost:5055/d3_network_json
